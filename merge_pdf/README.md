# Python Script: Simple Merge of PDF files

This script merges pdf files passed as arguments or - if not - piped via the
standard input. It writes the output to the file passed by the '-o' option. The
default output file is 'output.pdf'. The user is asked to overwrite the file in case of
existence.
