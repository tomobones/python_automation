# PNG Image Resize Automation

A python script to automate resizing png images. Passing file names as argument or through pipe is possible. In advance of the resizing process, a backup of each file is made by appending width and height to the name. The new file will have the old name. The size will be halfed in width and height. Maybe this will be customized by passing a factor after a flag.
